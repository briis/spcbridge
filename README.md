> [!NOTE]
> This is a clone from the original Lundix IT Home Assistant Integration. The reason for cloning and not forking is that I needed to make so many changes to almost all files, due to the upgrade to Home Assistant 2026.3.x and Python 3.1.4 dev environment, that I did not want to make changes directly to the initial code base.
In essence the functionality reamings the same, and if you want to replace the original Lundix Integration with this one, it will work the same way.
One addition is however the new Alarm Control Panel entity. See more information in the *Alarm System (panel)* section below.

> **This Integration is not supported by Lundix IT, all issue requests have to be submitted in this repository**


## Prerequisites
- Vanderbilt SPC panel, firmware version >= 3.8.5
- [SPC Bridge Generic Lite](https://www.lundix.se/spc-bridge-generic-lite/) or [SPC Bridge Generic](https://www.lundix.se/spc-bridge-generic/) from Lundix IT.
- Home Assistant system, Core version >= 2026.3.0, Frontend version >= 20260312.0

> [!NOTE]
> The software module **SPC Web Gateway** isn't supported by this integration.

## Introduction
Integrating your security system with Home Assistant (HA) can significantly enhance the functionality and convenience of your home automation. By using the motion detectors to control your lights and window sensors to control your HVAC system you can help maintain an ideal temperature and save money on your energy bills. You can also switch off all lights and close the water valve when you arm the security system and leave your home. This not only provides added security but also helps prevent damage in case of emergencies.

By using this custom integration for HA, you can access all states and status from your SPC security system and even arm/disarm the system, bypass zones, and control SPC outputs and doors. However, it's important to note that the allowed commands are determined by the settings in the SPC panel.

To integrate your security system with HA, you will need the SPC Bridge Generic (Lite) from Lundix IT. The communication is based on Vanderbilt's official protocol FlexC and is completely local on your own network, ensuring your data and safety.

The SPC Bridge HA integration consists of following parts:
- SPC Bridge component (spcbridge): a HA custom component.
- SPC Bridge library (pyspcbridge): a python library for interacting with the SPC Bridge REST/Websocket API.
- SPC Bridge Card (spcbridge-card): a HA custom card to controlling the SPC alarm system.

### Features
- Support for SPC areas, zones, outputs (mapping gates or virtual zones) and doors
- Encrypted local communication with the SPC Bridge
- Keypad controlled commands
- Allows the alarm detectors to be used for advanced automations in HA
- Support for multiple SPC systems (however a SPC Bridge is required for each SPC system)

## Installation

Before proceeding with the installation of this custom integration, make sure you have the the SPC Bridge Generic (lite) installed and properly configured.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have the Lundix Integration installed, you must remove that first, both by deleting the Integration from the Settings/Devices and from HACS. Remember to restart Home Assistant before proceding.

### HACS

Add `briis/spcbridge` as a custom repostiory in [HACS](https://www.hacs.xyz/) and add the component `Vanderbilt SPC Bridge`.

### Manual installation

You can also install the component manually as described below. You will need access to the Home Assistant filesystem, e.g., via the SSH add-on.

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/briis/spcbridge/releases) of the **spcbridge.zip** file and extract it into the `config/custom_components` directory in your HA installation. (If the `custom_components` directory does not exist, create it.)
2. Restart HA to load the integration into HA.
3. Go to **Settings -> Devices & services** and click on the **Add integration** button. Look for SPC Bridge and click to add it.
4. Follow the configuration instructions.

## User and Pin codes
To be able to identify the SPC user by the entered Keypad code (or user code in automaion actions) you have to select between two methods:

#### Method 1 - Include the SPC User ID in the Keypad Code
Enter the SPC user's ID followed by their PIN code. For example:
- For a user with ID 3 and PIN code 1289, enter 31289.
- For a user with ID 21 and PIN code 987077, enter 21987077.
> [!NOTE]
> This method is recommended because SPC user credentials do not need to be stored in the Home Assistant system, but it only works for users who have not been assigned a web password in the SPC system. The user profile for the user also need to have **User Rights - System > Web Access** enabled.

#### Method 2 - Link Keypad Codes to SPC Users
Manually link the Keypad codes to the corresponding SPC credentials. If you choose this method, you have to define the linking table in the configuration of the integration.
